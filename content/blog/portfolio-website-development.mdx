## The Challenge

We needed a portfolio website that could showcase our projects dynamically while maintaining excellent performance and developer experience.

## Our Approach

We chose Next.js with the App Router for its excellent performance characteristics and built-in optimizations. The key was creating a content management system using MDX files that would automatically update all pages when new projects were added.

## Key Decisions

### 1. MDX for Content Management
Using MDX files with frontmatter allows us to manage both projects and blog posts in a version-controlled, developer-friendly way.

### 2. Centralized Data Source
All pages pull from the same `getAllProjects()` function, ensuring consistency across the entire site.

### 3. Static Generation
Next.js static generation ensures fast loading times and excellent SEO performance.

## Technical Implementation

The system works by:
1. Reading MDX files from the content directory
2. Parsing frontmatter with Zod validation
3. Generating static pages at build time
4. Automatically updating all references when content changes

## Results

- **Build Time**: Under 30 seconds
- **Lighthouse Score**: 100/100
- **Developer Experience**: Add a project in one place, it appears everywhere
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for all project data

## Lessons Learned

The key to a maintainable portfolio is having a single source of truth. By centralizing all project data in MDX files, we eliminated the need to update multiple places when adding new content.
